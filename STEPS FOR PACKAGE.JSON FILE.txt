to create package.json file use 'npm.init'.
all packages and dependencies will be tracked here.
use 'npm install express -save' , here -save is used to save express as dependency on the file.
next install ejs as dependency by 'npm install ejs -save'
also here we are going to make post requests so setup body-parser by 'npm install body-parser -save'.
all required things downloaded.
since in main of package.json we specified main as app.js so we need to create app.js file to further continue work.
